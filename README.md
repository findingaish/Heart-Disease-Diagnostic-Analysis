# Heart Disease Diagnostic Analysis

## Overview

This Python project aims to analyze health and medical data related to heart disease for better future preparation. The dataset used in this analysis contains various attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other medical parameters.

The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on these attributes. By accurately identifying individuals at risk, healthcare professionals can intervene early and provide appropriate treatment, potentially saving lives and improving overall health outcomes.
